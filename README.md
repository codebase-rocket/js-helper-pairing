# Pairing Helper Library

This helper library provides functions to facilitate the pairing of devices or entities within a system. It offers methods to generate pairing codes to link a device or entity, retrieve pairing data for polling to check whether the entity is paired using this code, pair entities using pairing code, and consume pairing codes (delete it after the code is used for pairing).
